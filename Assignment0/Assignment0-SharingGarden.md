## 1.  Project Background

The sharing garden project is an initiative that aims to respond to the national call for energy conservation and emission reduction, by building a green and low-carbon campus. It actively promotes the development of a scientific, low-carbon, and efficient resource allocation model, to adapt to the development situation of higher education, and to promote the construction of an ecological civilization. The main action of this project is to transform the idle and abandoned land on campus into a sharing garden, which is designed and constructed by all students. This project aims to achieve the goal of participatory landscape design, and students can earn credits and rewards, such as potted plants, by participating. We will build a web-based application, which includes a sharing garden construction toolkit and a sharing garden community.

## 2.  Main Goals

1. Through this sharing garden project, we aim to master the ability to design a system, as this is the main goal of our Systems Analysis and Design course.

2. This project is of great significance to society as sustainable development has become a common goal for all countries worldwide. By building a green and low-carbon campus, we not only contribute to the cause of environmental protection, but also cultivate people's sense of responsibility towards sustainable development through public participation and collective maintenance. This helps promote the construction of an ecological civilization and spread the concept of energy conservation and emission reduction.

3. High-quality design is crucial for the successful development of the project. In this project, our aim is to create a shared garden that is both low-carbon and aesthetically pleasing, as well as based on public participation and collective maintenance. Good design can make the entire project more attractive and user-friendly, and reflect the professionalism and quality of the project.

## 6.  Novelty and Enhancements

1. Participatory Landscape Design: Traditional landscape design is often tailored to the designer's preferences and may not reflect the true needs and wants of the users. Our project promotes participatory landscape design, which involves the students in the design process, allowing them to create a more personalized and sustainable sharing garden that meets their needs and desires.

2. sharing Garden Toolkit: We provide a comprehensive toolkit for building a sharing garden, including guides for selecting appropriate plant species, building green infrastructure, and adopting sustainable gardening practices. These tools enable students to not only design a beautiful garden, but also to construct and maintain it in an environmentally friendly and socially responsible way.

3. Web-based sharing Garden Community: Our web-based platform provides a space for sharing garden enthusiasts to share their experiences, exchange knowledge, and collaborate on new projects. This community creates a learning environment where users can connect with like-minded individuals and work collectively to promote sustainable living.

4. Educational Opportunities: Our project provides students with valuable educational opportunities that extend beyond the classroom. Students learn about sustainable living through hands-on experience in building and maintaining sharing gardens. This type of experiential learning is an effective way to promote environmental consciousness and encourage responsible citizenship.

5. Multi-disciplinary Collaboration: Our project encourages interdisciplinary collaboration between students, faculty, and community organizations. This creates a community of stakeholders who work together to build sustainable sharing gardens, which promotes a sense of ownership and shared responsibility for the environment.
